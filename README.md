# Introduction

This module will enhance your ColdBox applications by providing out of the box security in the form of:

* A security rule engine for incoming requests
* Annotation driven security for handlers and actions

The module also has the capability to distinguish between invalid authentication and invalid authorization and determine an outcome of the process. The module also supports the ability to load/unload security rules from contributing modules. So you can create a nice HMVC hierarchy of security.

### Features

* Ability to have global security rules
* Ability for modules to add their own security rules and action overrides
* Ability to distinguish between authentication and authorization issues
* Annotation driven cascading security for handlers and actions
* Security rules can exist in:
  * XML File
  * JSON File
  * Database
  * Models
* The rules can be configured to use regular expressions or simple snippets
* Can use ColdFusion authentication security
* Can leverage any custom authentication provider
