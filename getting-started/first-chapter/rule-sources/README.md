# Rule Sources

The security firewall can be configured with rules that can come from many different sources:

* Declared inline in your `config/Coldbox.cfc`
* A JSON file
* An XML file
* From a model object via a method call
* From a database
* Declared inline in ANY module's `ModuleConfig.cfc`

Let's start exploring these sources.
